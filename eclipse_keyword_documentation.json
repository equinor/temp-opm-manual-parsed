The keyword is used with the Gas Field Operations option which is activated by the GASFIELD keyword in the RUNSPEC section. Gas contracts are commonly based on a Daily Contract Quantity (\u201cDCQ\u201d) that determines the gas rate that the field should be produced at, which is normally expressed as a multiple of the DCQ, for example 1.33, and is often referred to as the \u201cswing factor\u201d. Some gas contracts also define a maximum DCQ (\u201cMax DCQ\u201d) and/or a minimum take or pay DCQ (\u201cMin DCQ\u201d), as well as seasonal demand characteristics. For example, gas rates may be set higher in the winter months in order to meet heating demand compared with summer months in colder climates, and the opposite in warmer climates where air conditioning demand is high."
